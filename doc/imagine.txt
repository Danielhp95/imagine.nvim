Integration of text to image models into neovim. Currently only integration
with Stable-diffusion is implemented. Refer to plugin's Github README to see
how to install all of the required moving pieces.

USAGE                                                         *imagine.nvim-usage*


Call the setup function to activate: `require("imagine").setup({opts})`


Parameters:
  {opts} is a table with the following values:
  - `results_dir`: Results where generated images will be stored
  - `path_to_executable`: Path pointing to file to `nix` file which is used to
    load environment with Stable-diffusion dependencies.
  - `path_to_cmd_config`: Path to json file containing {config} (see below).
  - `cmd`: Command to be executed within Stable-diffusion environment.
  - `visual_selection_keymap`: Keymap for sending visual selection as prompt
    to model
  - `image_viewer`: External image viewer program to be used to render images
    outside of `nvim`
  - {config} is a table with the following values:
    - `model_config`: Stable-diffusion specific config. Find more info here under `optional arguments` in https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion#reference-sampling-script
    - `prompt_extras`: String to append at the end of prompt, for "prompt
      engineering"

                                                        *imagine.nvim.Imagine*

`:Imagine <text-prompt>`

Main plugin functionality. Passes `<text-prompt>` to Stable-diffusion and renders an image based on it. This is done by opening a `nvim` terminal, changing the terminal's working directory to `path_to_executable`, and running `cmd` with `model_config` and appending `prompt_extras` to `<text-prompt>`. These values are set within the plugin's `setup`call.

                                                *imagine.nvim.ImagineRemember*

`:ImagineRemember`

Opens a `Telescope.picker` showing the directories in `results_dir` (set during plugin `setup`) containing all generated images. Selecting one of them will open the pictures in directories based on `image_viewer` (set during plugin `setup`)

                                          *imagine.nvim.ImagineOpenConfigFile*

`:ImagineOpenConfigFile`

Opens config file containing `model_config` and `prompt_extras` which will be
used during the call to Stable-diffusion. These will be overriden every time
that the plugin's `setup` function is called. It is recommended to set
preferred config during `setup`.

                                          *imagine.nvim.ImagineSetConfigFile*

`:ImagineSetConfigFile <path-to-file>`

Sets path to json config file containing ` model_config` and `prompt_extras`(see `:help imagine.nvim.Imagine` for explanation) This path will be overriden every time that the plugin's `setup` function is called. It is recommended to set path to config file during `setup`.
